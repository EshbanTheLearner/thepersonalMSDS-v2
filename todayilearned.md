**Caution: This timeline is tailored for @EshbanTheLearner and might not be suitable for everyone.**

## Part - I (13 January 2020 to 22 April 2020)

### Day 08 | January 21, 2020 | Tuesday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about a special case of the relationship between two quantitative variables is the linear relationship. In this case, a straight line simply and adequately summarizes the relationship. When the scatterplot displays a linear relationship, we supplement it with the correlation coefficient (r). The least-squares regression line has the smallest sum of squared vertical deviations of the data points from the line. Extrapolation is the prediction of values of the explanatory variable that falls outside the range of the data.

**Description:** Following topics were covered:
- Case Q → Q: Linear Relationships
  - Introduction
  - Correlation
    - R - Coefficient of Correlation
    - Properties of R
  - Regression
  - Least Squares Regression
  - Intercept and Slope
  - Predictions

### Day 07 | January 20, 2020 | Monday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned how to graphically display the relationship between two quantitative variables and describe: a) the overall pattern and b) striking deviations from the pattern.

**Description:** Following topics were covered:
- Case Q → Q
  - Two Quantitative Variables
  - Scatterplots
    - Introduction
    - Interpretation
    - Examples
    - Labeled
    - Exercises

### Day 06 | January 19, 2020 | Sunday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about the C → C relationship between two categorical variables. Building a two-way table and interpreting the information stored in it about the association between two categorical variables by comparing conditional percentages.

**Description:** Following topics were covered:
- Case C → C
  - Two Categorical Variables
  - Conditional Percents
  - Exercises

### Day 05 | January 18, 2020 | Saturday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about how to examine relationships between 2 variables using visual displays and numerical summaries. 

**Description:** These includes the following topics:
- EDA: Examining Relationships
- Exploring Two Variables: Explanatory and Response
- Role-Type Classification
- Case C → Q
  - Introduction
  - Applications

### Day 04 | January 17, 2020 | Friday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned that the range covered by the data is the most intuitive measure of spread and is exactly the distance between the smallest data point (min) and the largest one (Max). Another measure of spread is the inter-quartile range (IQR), which is the range covered by the middle 50% of the data. The IQR can be used to detect outliers using the 1.5(IQR) criterion. Outliers are observations that fall below Q1 - 1.5(IQR) or above Q3 + 1.5(IQR). The five-number summary of distribution consists of the median (M), the two quartiles (Q1, Q3) and the extremes (Min, Max). The standard deviation measures the spread by reporting a typical (average) distance between the data points and their average.

**Description:** These includes the following topics:
- One Quantitative Variable: Measure of Spread
  - Range
  - Inter-Quartile Range
    - Using IQR to detect outliers
  - Outliers
    - Identification
    - Understanding
    - Handling
  - Boxplots
  - Standard Deviation
    - Idea
    - Notion
    - Calculation
    - Properties
    - Standard Deviation Rule
- WrapUp: EDA

### Day 03 | January 16, 2020 | Thursday
**Today's Progress:** Learned how to quantify the center and spread of distribution with various numerical measures, some of the properties of those numerical measures; and how to choose the appropriate numerical measures of center and spread to supplement the histogram.

**Description:** This includes the following:
- One Quantitative Variable: Measures of Center
  - Introduction
  - Mode
  - Median
  - Mean
  - Comparison b/w Mean and Median

### Day 02 | January 15, 2020 | Wednesday
