## Part - I (13 January 2020 to 22 April 2020)

### Day 13 | January 26, 2020 | Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned to identify the design of a study (controlled experiment vs. observational study) and other features of the study design (randomized, blind etc.).

**Description:** This includes the following:
- Producing Data: Designing Studies
  - Introduction
  - Types of Studies
    - Experimental Studies
    - Obesrvational Studies
      - Prospective
      - Retrospective


### Day 12 | January 25, 2020 | Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned various techniques by which one can choose a sample of individuals from an entire population to collect data from. This is seemingly a simple step in the big picture of statistics, but it turns out that it has a crucial effect on the conclusions we can draw from the sample about the entire population.

**Description:** This includes the following:
- Producing Data: Sampling
- Types of Samples
  - Volunteer Sample
  - Convenience Sample
  - Sampling Frame
  - Systematic Sampling
- Probability Sampling Plans
  - Simple Random Sampling
  - Cluster Sampling
  - Stratified Sampling 
- Wrap-Up: Sampling

### Day 11 | January 24, 2020 | Friday

**Today's Progress:** Today I summarized how to explore the relationship between the explanatory and response variables using visual displays and numerical measures, and how to choose what kind of measure to use based on the role-type classification of the two variables. I also emphasized how important it is to interpret any observed association in the context of the problem, but NOT to be tempted to interpret association as causation, due to the possible presence of lurking variables.


**Description:** This includes the following:
- Wrap-Up: Examining Relationships
- Summary: EDA

### Day 10 | January 23, 2020 | Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Today I learned how to recognize the distinction between association and causation, and identify potential lurking variables for explaining an observed relationship. Association **does not** imply causation!

**Description:** This includes the following:
- Causation and Lurking Variables
  - Introduction
  - Confounds
  - Simpson's Paradox

### Day 09 | January 22, 2020 | Wednesday
**Today's Progress:**

**Description:** This includes the following:
- AWS Builders Online Series
  - Introductory Guide to AWS Cost Management and Efficiency
  - Move Fast & Be Secure on AWS Cloud
  - AWS Purpose-Built Database Strategy: The Right Tool for The Right Job
  - Host your Static Website on Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
  - Building Serverless Applications that Scale
- Project Management Professional Certification: Introduction


### Day 08 | January 21, 2020 | Tuesday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about a special case of the relationship between two quantitative variables is the linear relationship. In this case, a straight line simply and adequately summarizes the relationship. When the scatterplot displays a linear relationship, we supplement it with the correlation coefficient (r). The least-squares regression line has the smallest sum of squared vertical deviations of the data points from the line. Extrapolation is the prediction of values of the explanatory variable that falls outside the range of the data.

**Description:** Following topics were covered:
- Case Q → Q: Linear Relationships
  - Introduction
  - Correlation
    - R - Coefficient of Correlation
    - Properties of R
  - Regression
  - Least Squares Regression
  - Intercept and Slope
  - Predictions

### Day 07 | January 20, 2020 | Monday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned how to graphically display the relationship between two quantitative variables and describe: a) the overall pattern and b) striking deviations from the pattern.

**Description:** Following topics were covered:
- Case Q → Q
  - Two Quantitative Variables
  - Scatterplots
    - Introduction
    - Interpretation
    - Examples
    - Labeled
    - Exercises

### Day 06 | January 19, 2020 | Sunday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about the C → C relationship between two categorical variables. Building a two-way table and interpreting the information stored in it about the association between two categorical variables by comparing conditional percentages.

**Description:** Following topics were covered:
- Case C → C
  - Two Categorical Variables
  - Conditional Percents
  - Exercises

### Day 05 | January 18, 2020 | Saturday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned about how to examine relationships between 2 variables using visual displays and numerical summaries. 

**Description:** These includes the following topics:
- EDA: Examining Relationships
- Exploring Two Variables: Explanatory and Response
- Role-Type Classification
- Case C → Q
  - Introduction
  - Applications

### Day 04 | January 17, 2020 | Friday
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned that the range covered by the data is the most intuitive measure of spread and is exactly the distance between the smallest data point (min) and the largest one (Max). Another measure of spread is the inter-quartile range (IQR), which is the range covered by the middle 50% of the data. The IQR can be used to detect outliers using the 1.5(IQR) criterion. Outliers are observations that fall below Q1 - 1.5(IQR) or above Q3 + 1.5(IQR). The five-number summary of distribution consists of the median (M), the two quartiles (Q1, Q3) and the extremes (Min, Max). The standard deviation measures the spread by reporting a typical (average) distance between the data points and their average.

**Description:** These includes the following topics:
- One Quantitative Variable: Measure of Spread
  - Range
  - Inter-Quartile Range
    - Using IQR to detect outliers
  - Outliers
    - Identification
    - Understanding
    - Handling

    - Standard Deviation Rule
- WrapUp: EDA

### Day 03 | January 16, 2020 | Thursday

  - Mode
  - Median
  - Mean
  - Comparison b/w Mean and Median
