**Today's Progress:** Today I learned that the range covered by the data is the most intuitive measure of spread and is exactly the distance between the smallest data point (min) and the largest one (Max). Another measure of spread is the inter-quartile range (IQR), which is the range covered by the middle 50% of the data. The IQR can be used to detect outliers using the 1.5(IQR) criterion. Outliers are observations that fall below Q1 - 1.5(IQR) or above Q3 + 1.5(IQR). The five-number summary of distribution consists of the median (M), the two quartiles (Q1, Q3) and the extremes (Min, Max). The standard deviation measures the spread by reporting a typical (average) distance between the data points and their average.
